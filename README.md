# Slot-Mechine-py
This project is a simple Python-based slot machine simulation. It models the core mechanics of a slot machine using OOP : spinning reels, randomly selecting symbols, tracking the current state, and determining a winning condition. The goal is educational—demonstrating randomness, class design, and basic game logic—rather than gambling realism.
